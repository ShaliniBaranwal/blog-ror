# Blog API in Ruby On Rails

I have added **multiple** blog contents using the RoR CLI.

To access the blog objects, you must run the project on localhost, and then send a **GET** request to the url: `https://localhost:{port}/myblog/{blog-id}`

All the screenshots of the command inputs have been given in the folder `./img`.
